## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add multiple background-image urls and position them using CSS, and I practiced more on using CSS Grid for layouts. I also improved my knowledge of semantic HTML. The CSS code below shows my implementation of multiple background images.

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--color-1);
  background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-position: top -45vw left -30vw, bottom -60vw right -20vw;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 80vw;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm going to keep reading up on semantic HTML so that my understanding of it will improve. I'm also going to build more projects so I can practice the concepts I've learned in both HTML and CSS.
